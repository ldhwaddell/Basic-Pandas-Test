# Basic-Pandas-Test

This short script takes a .csv file name from the user and then creates some tables and information based on the contents of the file

Script aims to find the total weight moved, average number of reps, average amount of weight, and percent change in weight moved

Then the data is plottted in three separate tables, with a little bit of information such as the slope of th eline of best fit, the y intercept, what the greatest percent change in weight moved is, and where that greatest change is found. 

For the record, none of the information is particularily useful or informative, but it was an enjoyable way to delve into working with .csv files, Pandas, numpy, and matplot lib, without just following along to what a tutorial is showing.
